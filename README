This print utility can print pdf from a Windows computer. It can be useful if you want to print via your local network with a linux computer.
I built it because my printer is a Dell printer which isn't supporting Linux.

You only have to run print.py in the background with python2.7.

If you want to edit this script feel free. ;)
